# mips-image-processing

A MIPS assembly program that will take in an image from a PPM file (storing in ASCII format) and manipulate it.

This will increase the brightness of all pixels by 10 in one case and will turn the image into greyscale on the other hand. 

This will then save the new image information to a file and record the result
